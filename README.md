# /snapit

> Create a snapshot NPM release with `/snapit` comment in a PR

This GitHub action allows for automation of [Changesets Snapshot Release](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/snapshot-releases.md) with the comment `/snapit` in a pull request. Snapshot releases are a way to release your changes for testing without updating the versions.

## Usage

Create a `.github/workflows/snapit.yml` file with the following contents.

**Deploy to NPM**

```yml
name: Snapit

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  snapit:
    name: Snapit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout default branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create snapshot version
        uses: Shopify/snapit@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
        with:
          build_script: pnpm build # Optional
          comment_command: /snapit # Default value not required
```

**Deploy to branch**

This is useful when orchestrating releases outside of GitHub actions or with other package registries.

```yml
name: Snapit

on:
  issue_comment:
    types:
      - created

jobs:
  snapit:
    name: Snapit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout default branch
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Create snapshot version
        uses: Shopify/snapit@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          branch: snapshot-release
          comment_command: /snapit # Default value not required
```

## Environment Variables

**`GITHUB_TOKEN`**

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is needed for changesets to look up the current changeset when creating a snapshot. You can use the automatically created [`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to authenticate in the workflow job](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#about-the-github_token-secret).

**`NPM_TOKEN`**

A `NPM_TOKEN` needs to be created and added to the repository to (publish packages from GitHub actions to the npm registry)[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-nodejs-packages#publishing-packages-to-the-npm-registry].
